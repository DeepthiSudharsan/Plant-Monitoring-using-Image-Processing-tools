### Basic Plant Monitoring using Image Processing Tools and using NDVI to analyse data from Servers 
### (Linking with IoT)

## Objective Of the Project:

The main objective of this project is to scale the health of the plant leaf from 0 to 1 using Vegetative Index tool obtained by Image processing and thus identify the diseases of the plant. An image processing algorithm was developed to identify the diseases. This will help the farmers to identify and rectify the diseases in the initial stage itself and will improve the cultivation with healthy plants.

## Requirements: 

* Live Plant leaves to analyse
* A camera
* MATLAB Version R2017a or higher 

## Theory

Report for the project has been uploaded.

## Conclusion:

The accurate detection and classification of the plant disease is very important for the successful cultivation of the crops, this can be done using digital image processing as seen in our project.
The proposed project has minimal errors, so for a large-scale production the number of cameras and length of conveyor system can be increased and modified. Capturing an accurate image at the correct angle with the fixed camera and varying lighting conditions from time to time is a big challenge as there is a chance of high uncertainty due to which analysis can give a mismatch with actual results. Due to factors like luminance and chrominance which will influence the results, we are taking the advantage of grey scale image which is less effected to the external environment changes as well as beneficial for finding size of a leaf. However, if possible we should always use IR camera to get best results.
